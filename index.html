						There's nothing better than a homemade burger. Everyone loves them, they're easy to
						make and, if made with quality, fresh ingredients (and not over laden with greasy
						stuff), they certainly don't have to be unhealthy, especially if served with a salad.
						Once you've mastered this tasty basic recipe, you can make it your own with different
						herbs, spices and toppings. The sky's the limit – that's why cooking is so exciting
